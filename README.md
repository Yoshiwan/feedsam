Header Content:

I moved the button off the menu and placed it with the above the fold content. In my experience most users are directly drawn to the fold so having the CTA there makes it more impactful. (I tried to style the button with the colors provided but for some reason just couldn't get it styled.)

I went with a border in the navbar to make it pop more and have more impact on the user.

Fold Content:

I changed the heading text to h4 text to red, I found the green too hard to see and easily missed. I also made the h1 text italic so it provided a more clean look to the fold. 

Footer:

I decided to go with a box shadow on the row to make the footer pop more on the page.

Thanks Again For This Opportunity!
